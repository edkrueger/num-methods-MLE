In this repo, I compare the numerical convergence rates of Gradient Descent, Newton-Rhapson and The Method of Scoring in implementing MLE of a parameter of Weibull distributed data.

There is a Jupyter Notebook (weibull_mle.ipynb). It can be viewed on GitHub, but GitHub may not render some of the LaTeX correctly. It can also be run on your own computer provided you have the correct packages provided in requirements.txt (for pip) or environment.yml (for conda).
