In this notebook, I compare the numerical convergence rates of Gradient Descent, Newton-Rhapson and The Method of Scoring in implementing MLE of a parameter of Weibull distributed data.

There are two versions of the notebook:
* One is the Jupyter Notebook (weibull_mle.ipynb): This version can be viewed on GitHub. It can also be run on your own computer provided you have the correct packages. It was made using Anaconda 5.0.1. 
* The other an HTML file (weibull_mle.html): This version will contain the timings from my computer and can be downloaded and opened in a browser.
